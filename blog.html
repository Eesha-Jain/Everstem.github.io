		<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>I grew up in a hamlet (which
				is smaller than a village) in northern Alberta in Canada.&nbsp; My nearest
				neighbors were on an adjacent farm 1/2 mile away, and we only had one TV
				channel.&nbsp; The primary industries in my area were farming, oil and gas, and
				forestry. Technology wasn't very prevalent in my daily life, but my favorite
				subject in school was math. While I thoroughly enjoyed living on a farm, I knew
				that I wanted to go to post-secondary education, and early on, my dream was to
				be a lawyer.</span></p>
		

		<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>That changed during a school
				trip. I was also part of our school's band program, and while I was in high
				school, we did a weekend exchange program with another band in a city that was
				10 hours away. I ended up sleeping on a sofa bed at the exchange family and
				noticed that they had a TRS-80 color computer. As intrigued as I was with the
				device, I didn't want to touch it, so I took advantage of the manuals sitting
				on the coffee table and spent my evenings (when I was supposed to be sleeping)
				reading and learning about the computer. I also learned about BASIC.</span></p>
		
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>When I got home to the farm,
				I convinced my family to help me save for my very own computer.&nbsp; After
				many chores and months of saving, I had enough to buy a TRS-80 Model III for
				myself.&nbsp; Each night I would finish my farm work and then my homework and
				race to the computer to immerse myself in all its wonderment. This was new for
				me and for everyone around me. It was addicting and gratifying at the same
				time. Shortly after getting the computer, I realized I was spending upwards of
				30 hours on it. I thought to myself, &quot;if I only did another 10 hours per
				week, this could be my career.&quot;</span></p>
		
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Which is what I ultimately
				ended up doing. I attended university and obtained my Bachelor of Science in
				Computing Science. From there, I got a job as a computer-based bookkeeper for a
				local ice supply company and then as a computer programmer for a scientific
				research lab, all the while experimenting and playing with the technology
				beyond what was required of my job. I eventually shared some code on how to
				integrate Oracle and the internet...before, the internet was a thing, which led
				me to work for Oracle, and then ultimately for Microsoft. I have been with
				Microsoft for 24 years, and each day is as unique and challenging as the first.</span></p>
		
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>A career in STEM is like a
				blank notebook. There are guides and rules, but the story is yours to write.
				There are endless opportunities to learn, collaborate, and innovate. I am
				forever grateful for the set of circumstances that introduced me to this
				career, and I still love what I do decades later.</span></p>

				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On October 9th and 10th, we
				hosted a free 1-hour college application walkthrough through Zoom. We
				understand that it's very easy to feel overwhelmed with all the college
				deadlines, and we wanted to help make the application process more
				manageable.&nbsp;</span></p>
		

		<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'><span
				style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Our first day focused on
				getting started and setting up accounts on the Common App and/or Coalition. On
				the second day, we went over how to fill out the activities list along with
				some general tips and tricks. The walkthroughs were conducted one-on-one and
				were largely discussion-based. This provided us with more flexibility and we
				were able to better cater our advice to each individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
